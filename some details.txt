so this uses wovels, as a soul urge, how about using only unique consonants as in hebrew? pls tell me if that makes any sense and if it does, what the result will mean?

Great question! Let’s break it down:
1. Current Approach: Soul Urge Number (Vowels)
In Western numerology, the Soul Urge Number (sometimes called the Heart’s Desire Number) is calculated using the vowels in a person’s name.
The idea is that vowels represent the “inner self,” your true desires, and what motivates you at a soul level.
2. Your Proposal: Unique Consonants (as in Hebrew)
In Hebrew gematria and some Kabbalistic traditions, the focus is often on the consonants of a name, since Hebrew is written without vowels.
Using only unique consonants (i.e., each consonant counted once, regardless of repetition) is a further restriction, not standard in most numerological systems, but it does have some logic:
Consonants are seen as the “structure” or “body” of a word, while vowels are the “breath” or “spirit.”
Using only unique consonants could be interpreted as focusing on the essential, unchanging “skeleton” of a person’s name—what is fundamentally present, regardless of how often it appears.
3. Does it Make Sense?
Numerologically:
It’s not a standard method, but it is a valid experiment, especially if you want to draw inspiration from Hebrew or Kabbalistic traditions.
It would represent a person’s “core structure” or “essential identity” as encoded in their name, stripped of repetition and the “breath” of vowels.
Interpretation:
The resulting number could be seen as a symbol of the person’s innate, immutable qualities—the “bones” of their character, as opposed to the “spirit” (vowels) or the “expression” (all letters).
In a report, you might call this the Essential Identity Number or Core Structure Number.
4. How to Calculate
Take the name, extract all consonants, remove duplicates, sum their values (using your chosen numerology system), and reduce to a single digit (digital root).
Example:
Name: Sergey Kryuchkov
Consonants: S, R, G, K, Y, C, H, V (unique, ignoring repeats)
Assign values (e.g., A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26), sum, and reduce.
5. What the Result Will Mean
The result is a number that represents the fundamental, unchanging aspects of a person’s identity as encoded in their name.
It’s less about desires or outward expression, and more about the “core” or “essence” that remains constant.
Summary:
Yes, it makes sense as a numerological experiment, especially if you want to draw on Hebrew or Kabbalistic symbolism. The result would be a new kind of number—perhaps best described as the “Essential Identity Number”—representing the immutable core of a person’s name.
Would you like to add this calculation to your script? If so, I can implement it and suggest how to present it in your reports!
we may have some base consonants also, does thi make sense?

Yes, the idea of “base consonants” does make sense, especially if you are drawing inspiration from Hebrew or other Semitic languages, or if you want to create a numerological system that focuses on the most fundamental elements of a name.
What are “Base Consonants”?
In Hebrew and some other languages, certain consonants are considered “base” or “root” letters, especially when analyzing the roots of words (as in triliteral roots in Semitic languages).
In the context of names, “base consonants” could mean:
The distinct root consonants of a name, ignoring any modifications, double letters, or “soft”/“hard” forms.
For example, in “Sergey Kryuchkov,” the base consonants might be S, R, G, K, Y, C, H, V (as in your previous example), but you might further reduce this if you have a specific set of “base” consonants you want to focus on.
Does it Make Sense Numerologically?
Yes, if you define your system clearly.
Using only base/root consonants is a way to focus on the “deepest” or “most essential” elements of a name, similar to how root words in Hebrew carry the core meaning.
This approach is not standard in Western numerology, but it is conceptually valid and can be meaningful if you explain your reasoning and method.
What Would the Result Mean?
The resulting number would represent the core, foundational energies of a person’s name—what is most essential and unchanging.
It could be interpreted as the “root” of a person’s character or destiny, as opposed to the more “surface” or “expressive” aspects.
How to Define “Base Consonants”?
You need to decide:
Do you mean all unique consonants in the name?
Or do you want to map certain consonants to a smaller set of “base” forms (e.g., treating C, K, and Q as the same base sound)?
Or do you want to use only the first occurrence of each consonant, or only the root consonants as in Hebrew triliteral roots?
Example Approaches
All Unique Consonants:
As previously described: S, R, G, K, Y, C, H, V
Mapped to Base Forms:
For example, C/K/Q → K, F/PH → F, etc.
Root Extraction (Hebrew-style):
Extract the “root” consonants as you would for a Hebrew word.
Summary:
Using “base consonants” is a valid and interesting approach, especially for a system inspired by Hebrew or linguistic roots.
The result would symbolize the most fundamental, unchanging qualities of a person’s name.
The key is to clearly define what you mean by “base consonants” and apply it consistently.
Would you like to:
Use all unique consonants as “base”?
Map consonants to a smaller set of base forms?
Or use another method?

how about the book of herman wirth, he had the ideas of base consonants there

Herman Wirth was a Dutch-German historian, philologist, and controversial figure, best known for his work on ancient symbols, runes, and proto-languages. He was one of the founders of the Ahnenerbe, and his work often focused on the origins of European and Indo-European culture, language, and symbolism.
Wirth and Base Consonants
Wirth’s ideas, especially in works like “Der Aufgang der Menschheit” (“The Rise of Humanity”), often revolved around the concept of primordial language and the symbolic meaning of sounds and letters. He believed that:
The earliest forms of language were based on a small set of root sounds or base consonants.
These base consonants carried archetypal, symbolic meanings that were reflected in ancient runes, pictograms, and proto-languages.
The consonants, more than vowels, were seen as the “bones” or “structure” of language, with vowels being the “breath” or “spirit” (a concept also found in Hebrew and other traditions).
What Did Wirth Mean by “Base Consonants”?
Base consonants (Grundkonsonanten) in Wirth’s theory are the fundamental, irreducible sounds from which all words and meanings are derived.
He often tried to trace modern words, names, and symbols back to these root consonants, suggesting that they carried deep, universal meanings.
Wirth sometimes mapped different consonants to a smaller set of archetypal sounds, similar to how some linguistic theories group consonants by their place or manner of articulation.
Does This Make Sense in Numerology?
Yes, if you want to create a system inspired by Wirth:
You would reduce a name to its “base consonants” (as defined by Wirth or your own mapping).
You would then assign values to these consonants and sum them, as in other numerological systems.
The result would be interpreted as the “archetypal” or “primordial” essence of the name, connecting the individual to ancient symbolic meanings.
What Would the Result Mean?
The number derived from base consonants would represent the deepest, most archetypal energies of a person’s name, according to Wirth’s theory.
It would be less about personality or desire, and more about ancestral, mythic, or universal qualities.
How to Implement Wirth’s Approach?
Define the Set of Base Consonants:
You may need to consult Wirth’s tables or summaries (if available) to see how he grouped consonants.
If not, you can create your own mapping based on his principles (e.g., grouping similar sounds).
Reduce the Name:
Extract the base consonants from the name, according to your mapping.
Assign Values and Calculate:
Assign numbers to each base consonant (A=1, B=2, etc., or another system).
Sum and reduce as usual.
Example (Hypothetical Mapping)
Suppose Wirth grouped consonants as follows (this is illustrative, not a direct quote from his work):
B, P, F, V → “B” (labials)
D, T, Th → “D” (dentals)
G, K, Q, C → “G” (gutturals)
L, R, N, M → “L” (liquids/nasals)
S, Z, Sh, Ch → “S” (sibilants)
Name: Sergey Kryuchkov
S, R, G, K, Y, C, H, V
Map to base: S, R (L), G (G/K/C), H, V (B)
Assign values, sum, reduce.
References
Herman Wirth, “Der Aufgang der Menschheit” (1928, 1931) and related works.
Wirth’s ideas are not mainstream linguistics or numerology, but they are influential in some esoteric and symbolic traditions.
Summary:
Wirth’s “base consonants” are about finding the most fundamental, archetypal sounds in a name, believed to connect to ancient symbolic meanings. Using this in numerology would give you a number representing the “primordial essence” of a name.
If you want to implement this, you’ll need to decide on a mapping of modern consonants to Wirth’s base consonants (or use his if you have access to his tables). I can help you set up such a mapping and calculation if you’d like!
ok, so now we should  have matrices and reports for angel/soul urge, then given hebrew and separately given wirths, and the summation of report (also correct the prompt) should build a comparison table of those 3 types of matrices

Here’s a plan to implement your request:
Plan
1. Generate Three Types of Matrices
Angel/Soul Urge: Based on vowels (current Western numerology).
Hebrew-style: Based on unique consonants (as in Hebrew, no vowels).
Wirth’s Base Consonants: Based on mapped “base consonants” per Wirth’s theory.
Each type will have its own set of personal numbers, and thus its own set of magic squares.
2. Generate Reports for Each Type
For each type, generate a detailed report using the corresponding matrices and personal numbers.
3. Comparison Table
At the end of the report, add a table comparing the matrices (and possibly the derived numbers) for all three types, side by side.
4. Prompt Correction
Update the prompt so it clearly explains the three systems, and instructs the LLM to compare and contrast them in the summary.
Implementation Details
A. Calculation Functions
Add functions to extract:
Vowel-based numbers (already present)
Unique consonant-based numbers (Hebrew-style)
Wirth’s base consonant numbers (using a mapping you define)
B. Matrix Generation
For each system, generate the list of personal numbers and then the magic squares.
C. Report Generation
For each system, generate a report section.
At the end, generate a comparison table.
D. Prompt Update
The prompt should explain the three systems and instruct the LLM to compare them.
Next Steps
Do you have a specific mapping for Wirth’s base consonants, or should I use a reasonable default (e.g., groupings as in my previous message)?
Do you want the comparison table to show just the matrices, or also the derived personal numbers?
If you confirm or clarify the above, I will proceed to:
Add the new calculation functions,
Update the report and prompt logic,
Ensure the output is as you described.
Let me know your preferences, and I’ll implement the changes!
